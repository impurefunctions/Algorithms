# How to contribute an implementation (code)?
Have a look at open issues. They contain the list of algorithms we plan to be implemented. 

Pick an unassigned issue.

You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.

Make sure you are assigned for the issue.

Create a PR and send.

Be sure to not include any compiled binaries in the patch.
While sending a PR make sure you follow one issue per PR rule.

# Suggesting an algorithm
First make sure you are not suggesting a duplicate.

If not, proceed and create the issue.

Title of issue should be of the following format -

`AlgorithmName`

# Use a Consistent Coding Style
Code submitted should be modular.

Don't use global variables.

# Write Good Commit Messages
A commit message consists of 3 parts:

*shortlog

*commit body

*issue reference Example:

*quicksort.py Add QuickSort Algorithm

`This adds QuickSort Algorithm which return the concatenation of the
quicksorted list of elements that are less than or equal to the pivot, the
pivot, and the quicksorted list of elements that are greater than the pivot.`
